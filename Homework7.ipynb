We then apply a classification tree to each bootstrapped sample and, for a specific value of X, produce 10 estimates of P(Class is Red|X): 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.2, 0.55, 0.6, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, and 0.75.\n",

The second approach is to classify based on the average probability. What is the final classification under each of these two approaches? What does the difference in classification aggregation (if any) tell us about tree approaches?"
